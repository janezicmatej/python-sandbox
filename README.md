While i originally though this would be a magnificent return to my projectEuler journey I quickly realised I would currently much rather spend time playing around with GitHub actions, python tools like
- black
- isort
- pylint
- pydantic

and other things such as developing some tools in python that I think are cool. Basically from now on this will be my python sandbox repo.

I will probably still solve some problems here or there but not as actively as I thought initially.

Currently, TODO list includes:
- [ ] configure pylint
- [ ] configure pydantic
- [ ] play around with GitHub actions
- [ ] improve on the runner script
